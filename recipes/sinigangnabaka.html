      <li>2 large Roma tomatoes, quartered</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon patis fish sauce</li>
      <li>6 gabi or taro or potatoes, peeled and halved depending on size</li>
      <li>2 finger chilies</li>
      <li>
        1 (6 inches) radish (labanos or daikon), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch
        thick on a bias
      </li>
      <li>
        15 large tamarind pieces or 1 1/2 (1.41 ounces each) packages tamarind
        base powder
      </li>
      <li>1 bunch kangkong Chinese water spinach</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a pot over medium heat, combine beef ribs and water. Bring to a boil,
        skimming scum that floats on top.
      </li>
      <li>When the broth has cleared, add onions, tomatoes, and fish sauce.</li>
      <li>
        Lower heat, cover and cook for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until meat is
        fork-tender.
      </li>
      <li>Add gabi or taro and cook for about 6 to 8 minutes or until soft.</li>
      <li>
        Add chili and radish. Continue to simmer for about 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Trim about 2 inches from the kangkong stalks and discard. Cut kangkong
        into 3-inch lengths, separating the sturdier stalks from the leaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using packaged tamarind base, add into the pot and stir until
        completely dissolved. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add kangkong Chinese water spinach and continue to cook for about 1
        minute. Serve hot, preferably with warm steamed white rice on the side.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cooking Steps When Using Fresh Tamarind</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash tamarind and place in a pot with 1 cup water. Bring to a boil and
        cook until soft and outer skins begin to burst.
      </li>
      <li>With a fork, mash tamarinds.</li>
      <li>
        In a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl, pour tamarind and liquid.
        Continue to mash with a fork, returning some of the liquid into the
        strainer once or twice, to fully extract the juice.
      </li>
      <li>Discard seeds and skins. Pour tamarind juice into the sinigang.</li>
    </ol>
